    ---------Air Quality Report Dashboard--------
##Introduction:

This project presents an interactive Air Quality Report Dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard offers a visual representation of air pollution levels across various Indian cities. It enables users to assess the environmental health of different regions and identify trends in air quality metrics over time.

##Problem Statement:

Air pollution poses significant risks to public health and environmental sustainability. There is a critical need to:

Track Air Quality Index (AQI) across different cities.

Understand the concentration of harmful pollutants such as CO, NO₂, SO₂, and PM2.5.

Monitor trends in air quality over the years.

Enable government agencies and citizens to take informed actions based on real-time data.

## Steps Followed
1. Data Collection
Collected historical air quality data from government or open-source pollution monitoring websites.

Dataset includes columns like city, year, AQI, pollutant concentrations (CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5), and population.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed null or inconsistent values.

Ensured correct data types for time series analysis.

Filtered out irrelevant fields to maintain clarity.

3. Power BI Visualization

Filters and Slicers to view data city-wise.

Bar Charts to compare AQI across cities.

Line Chart to show year-wise AQI trend (2015–2020).

KPI Cards for key pollutant metrics like:

Average CO: 7.14

Average NO₂: 46.97

Average PM2.5: 101.63

Total SO₂: 119.90

Map Visualization to show area-wise AQI overview using colored bubbles.

4. Final Touches
Applied background gradients and consistent color schemes for a professional look.

Added a title, refresh date, and map interaction to enhance the user experience.
